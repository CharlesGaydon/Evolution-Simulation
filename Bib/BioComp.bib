abstract = {Purified RNA polymerase II initiated transcription from the yeast CUP1 promoter fused to a C-less cassette if the DNA was negatively supercoiled. Relaxed plasmid was not transcribed. Transcription did not require addition of any other transcription factors. TATA box-binding protein (TBP) was not detectable in the polymerase preparation and the TATA box was not required. Deletion analysis of the CUP1 promoter revealed that a 25-bp element containing the initiation region was sufficient for recognition by polymerase. Two transcription start sites were mapped, one of which is identical to one of the two major start sites observed in vivo. Our observations can be accounted for by using a theoretical analysis of the probability of DNA melting within the plasmid as a function of superhelix density: the CUP1 initiation element is intrinsically unstable to superhelical stress, permitting entry of the polymerase, which then scans the DNA to locate the start site. In support of this analysis, the CUP1 promoter was sensitive to mung bean nuclease. These observations and a previous theoretical analysis of yeast genes support the idea that promoters are stress points within the DNA superhelix. The role of transcription factors might be to mark the promoter and to regulate specific melting of promoter DNA.},

abstract = {As RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes a gene, it encounters an array of well-ordered nucleosomes. How it traverses through this array in vivo remains unresolved. One model proposes that torsional stress generated during transcription destabilizes nucleosomes ahead of Pol II. Here, we describe a method for high resolution mapping of underwound DNA using next-generation sequencing, and show that torsion is correlated with gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster cells. Accumulation of torsional stress, through topoisomerase inhibition, results in increased. Pol II at transcription start sites. Whereas Topo I inhibition results in increased nascent RNA transcripts, Topo II inhibition shows little change. Despite the different effects on Pol II elongation, topoisomerase inhibition results in increased nucleosome turnover and salt solubility within gene bodies, suggesting that the elongation-independent effects of torsional stress on nucleosome},

@article{Meyer2014,
abstract = {DNA torsional stress is generated by virtually all biomolecular processes involving the double helix, in particular transcription where a significant level of stress propagates over several kilobases. If another promoter is located in this range, this stress may strongly modify its opening properties, and hence facilitate or hinder its transcription. This mechanism implies that transcribed genes distant of a few kilobases are not independent, but coupled by torsional stress, an effect for which we propose the first quantitative and systematic model. In contrast to previously proposed mechanisms of transcriptional interference, the suggested coupling is not mediated by the transcription machineries, but results from the universal mechanical features of the double-helix. The model shows that the effect likely affects prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes, but with different consequences owing to their different basal levels of torsion. It also depends crucially on the relative orientation of the genes, enhancing the expression of eukaryotic divergent pairs while reducing that of prokaryotic convergent ones. To test the in vivo influence of the torsional coupling, we analyze the expression of isolated gene pairs in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Their orientation and distance dependence is fully consistent with the model, suggesting that torsional gene coupling may constitute a widespread mechanism of (co)regulation in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {We develop a statistical mechanical model to analyze the competitive behavior of transitions to multiple alternate conformations in a negatively supercoiled DNA molecule of kilobase length and specified base sequence. Since DNA superhelicity topologically couples together the transition behaviors of all base pairs, a unified model is required to analyze all the transitions to which the DNA sequence is susceptible. Here we present a first model of this type. Our numerical approach generalizes the strategy of previously developed algorithms, which studied superhelical transitions to a single alternate conformation. We apply our multi-state model to study the competition between strand separation and B-Z transitions in superhelical DNA. We show this competition to be highly sensitive to temperature and to the imposed level of supercoiling. Comparison of our results with experimental data shows that, when the energetics appropriate to the experimental conditions are used, the competition between these two transitions is accurately captured by our algorithm. We analyze the superhelical competition between B-Z transitions and denaturation around the c-myc oncogene, where both transitions are known to occur when this gene is transcribing. We apply our model to explore the correlation between stress-induced transitions and transcriptional activity in various organisms. In higher eukaryotes we find a strong enhancement of Z-forming regions immediately 5' to their transcription start sites (TSS), and a depletion of strand separating sites in a broad region around the TSS. The opposite patterns occur around transcript end locations. We also show that susceptibility to each type of transition is different in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. By analyzing a set of untranscribed pseudogenes we show that the Z-susceptibility just downstream of the TSS is not preserved, suggesting it may be under selection pressure.},
